This is a simple 2d slideshooter python game, the objective of the game is to go through the levels, defeating various enemies and reach the end alive

to run the code, first download all of the files from prototype 2 and keep them in 1 folder 
run the level_editor to create a world level anyhow you'd like, majority of the tiles are non collidable decoration blocks, the invisible white tile is what the objects will collide with, a few enemy characters and a compulsory player character, a simple example csv file is already there
run the gamemodel1 and you should see the world map with your player character

prototype 2 with comments contains the same python codes except they are modularised with comments to make it more easily understandable
